// If you're using Vitest, you only need to configure the test files in the vitest.config.ts for your testing environment. You don't need to include the __tests__ directory in the tsconfig.app.json file unless you specifically need TypeScript to treat the test files as part of the application (which is uncommon for testing purposes).

// If you want TypeScript to type-check your test files and include them in the overall compilation, you would need to keep the "include": ["__tests__/**/*"] in your tsconfig.app.json.
// {
//   "include": ["src/**/*", "__tests__/**/*"]
// }
// This is telling TypeScript to look for type definitions and files inside src/ and __tests__/ during the compilation process. This is especially important if you are using TypeScript for building the project, not just running tests.

// tsconfig.app.json (Frontend - React + Vitest)
// ðŸ“Œ Modify tsconfig.app.json to extend tsconfig.base.json:
// ðŸ‘‰ Why?

// Keeps tsconfig.base.json for common settings.
// Includes types: ["vitest/globals"] so you donâ€™t need @types/jest.
// Targets ESNext for modern JavaScript.
// Includes all frontend (src/) files.
